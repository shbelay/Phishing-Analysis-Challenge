# Day 2 – Phishing Analysis Challenge (Personal Reflection)

On Day 2 of the phishing analysis challenge, we moved beyond the theory and got hands-on with a real-world scenario. Our instructor, [Rajneesh G.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajneeshgupta01/) provided a sample suspicious email for us to investigate. It wasn’t known if it was phishing or a legitimate message.  

The email appeared to come from a credit card company and claimed that the recipient had **92,990 reward points** that were about to expire. Naturally, this type of message could catch a user’s attention and push them to act quickly, whether by trying to redeem the points or clicking on a provided link. That “too good to miss” urgency is exactly what makes this kind of email suspicious.  

From the provided scenario, this was sent to an employee and submitted to the security team. As a SOC analyst, this is where I step in. My task was to take this email and begin analyzing the message to determine whether it was a phishing attempt or a genuine communication.  

This exercise really highlighted how phishing investigations often start with very little information. The challenge for me was to apply the process I learned on Day 1: check the headers, analyze the sender’s domain, review the content, and investigate any links before making a determination.
